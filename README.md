# YouPlayedYourself

 This is just a fun idea that I had after watching [DJ Khaled's interview on Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcEpHnaZMgg&t=1s). I also highly recommend looking at [khaledipsum.com](http://khaledipsum.com/) because it's hilarious.

 ### How it Works

 Just go [here](http://anthonycodes.com/youPlayedYourself) and on every pageload a new DJ Khaled gif will appear. Powered using the giphy API.

 #### Things to keep in mind

  1. It might take a second for a new gif to load initially because it takes a minute for the server to wake up.
  2. All gifs are tagged with DJ Khaled, but that doesn't guarantee the gif will include him. Some are just vaguely associated.
